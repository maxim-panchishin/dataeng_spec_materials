# Airflow Exercises

These exercises are a collection of my assignments for a course I took in 2021-2022 to showcase my Airflow skills.

## DAGs
1. Write a simple DAG with Bash and Python operators.
2. The DAG obtains the execution date and makes an SQL query to Greenplum to select data based on the day of the week of the current execution date.
3. ETL: Retrieve data from an API using a custom operator and insert the data into the Greenplum database.
